## Does moving to a new job during the Stamp 1 affects the 2 years time counting to apply for a Stamp 4? ##

No. Only during the first year of Stamp 1 you must stay with the same employer, but after that period you can move to another job without affecting the 24 months countdown to be eligible for a Stamp 4. It is necessary to return the current Working Permit documents and reapply with the new company.
